# Institutional Partnership Proposal: Credit Report Analyzer (CRA)

## Executive Summary
CRA Enterprise is a specialized, local-first forensic analysis platform designed for Legal Aid organizations, Law Firms, and Consumer Advocacy groups. It automates the detection of Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) violations with institutional-grade accuracy.

*   **Metro 2 Compliance Audit**: Verify data against industry-standard reporting formats.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: AI-powered detection of "Zombied Debt" and illegal "Re-aging" practices.

### 3. Legal Readiness
