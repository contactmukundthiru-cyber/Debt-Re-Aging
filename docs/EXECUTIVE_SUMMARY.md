# Credit Report Analyzer
## Executive Summary for Decision Makers

### The Problem

**Debt re-aging is illegal but widespread.** Collection agencies manipulate dates on credit reports to extend the 7-year reporting period, keeping negative items visible longer than legally allowed. This:

- Unfairly damages consumer credit scores
- Violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Disproportionately affects low-income communities
- Creates liability for organizations that fail to catch these violations

**Manual detection is time-consuming and error-prone.** Trained staff can spend 30-60 minutes per case reviewing dates, calculating timelines, and drafting dispute letters.
