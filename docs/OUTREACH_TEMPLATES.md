## Email Template 1: Initial Outreach to Legal Aid Organizations

**Subject:** Free Tool to Identify Debt Re-Aging in Credit Reports - Pilot Opportunity

---

Dear [Name/Organization],

I'm reaching out to share a free tool (free for personal and nonprofit use; commercial use requires a paid license) that may help your organization serve clients dealing with credit report issues more efficiently.

**The Problem:**
Many consumers, particularly those in underserved communities, have debts illegally "re-aged" on their credit reports—making negative items stay longer than the law allows. Identifying these violations requires time-consuming manual analysis of dates and calculations.

**The Solution:**
The **Credit Report Analyzer** automates this analysis. Upload a credit report snippet, and in minutes the tool:
- Extracts key dates and account information
- Runs 10+ automated checks for FCRA violations
- Generates professional dispute documentation

**Key Features:**
- Free for personal and nonprofit use (commercial use requires a paid license)
- Completely local—no client data leaves your computer
- Generates dispute letters and documentation automatically
- Includes 50-state Statute of Limitations database

**Pilot Opportunity:**
We're inviting legal aid organizations to pilot this tool. Participation includes:
- Free installation support
- Staff training (2 hours)
- Ongoing technical assistance

**Time Commitment:** 4-6 weeks for pilot, processing 10-20 cases

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss whether this tool could help your clients?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

## Email Template 4: Outreach to Community Organizations

**Subject:** Free Credit Report Tool for Your Financial Literacy Program

---

Dear [Name],

I learned about [Organization]'s work helping community members with financial wellness, and I wanted to share a free tool that might complement your programs.

**What It Does:**
The Credit Report Analyzer helps identify when debt collectors may have illegally manipulated dates on credit reports. This practice, called "re-aging," keeps negative items on credit reports longer than the law allows, unfairly harming people who are trying to rebuild their credit.

**How It Helps Your Clients:**
- Identifies potential issues in credit reports
- Generates dispute letters clients can send
- Explains the findings in plain language
- Works completely on your computer—client data stays private

**How It Helps Your Organization:**
- Adds a powerful service to your financial literacy offerings
- Requires minimal technical expertise to use
- Free staff training included
- Can refer complex cases to legal aid partners

**Not Legal Advice:**
The tool helps identify potential issues but is not a substitute for legal advice. For complex cases, we recommend partnering with local legal aid organizations.

Would you like to schedule a demonstration? I'm happy to show your team how the tool works and discuss whether it's a good fit for your programs.

Thank you for the important work you do!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Conference Presentation Abstract

**Title:** Automating FCRA Compliance Checks: A Free Tool for Legal Aid

**Abstract (250 words):**

Debt re-aging—the illegal manipulation of dates on credit reports to extend the reporting period beyond statutory limits—disproportionately affects low-income consumers who lack resources to identify and challenge these violations. Traditional analysis requires attorneys to manually calculate date differentials across multiple data points, consuming valuable time that could be spent on representation.

This presentation introduces the Credit Report Analyzer, a free tool (free for personal and nonprofit use; commercial use requires a paid license) that automates the identification of potential FCRA timeline violations. The tool processes credit report snippets using OCR technology, extracts relevant dates and account information, and applies over 10 transparent rules based on established FCRA principles. When issues are detected, it generates professional dispute documentation including bureau letters, furnisher letters, and debt validation requests.

Key features include:
- 100% local processing with no cloud data transmission
- Support for PDF and image uploads, including mobile photos
- 50-state Statute of Limitations database
- Multi-language support (English and Spanish)
- Complete audit trail of analysis and edits

Pilot results from legal aid organizations demonstrate significant time savings (averaging 1.5 hours per case) and a 25% detection rate for high-severity violations that might otherwise go unnoticed.

Attendees will learn:
1. How debt re-aging harms consumers
2. How the tool identifies potential violations
3. How to implement the tool in their organization
4. Best practices from pilot deployments

The presentation includes a live demonstration and time for Q&A.

**Keywords:** FCRA, credit reporting, legal technology, consumer protection, access to justice

### Twitter/X Thread
```
🧵 Thread: Why debt re-aging is a hidden crisis for consumers, and what we're doing about it

1/ Debt re-aging is when collectors manipulate dates on credit reports to keep negative items reporting longer than legally allowed.

2/ Under the FCRA, most negative items must be removed 7 years from the Date of First Delinquency (DOFD). But some collectors report new dates when they buy old debts.

3/ This illegally extends the reporting period, damaging credit scores and making it harder for people to get housing, jobs, and credit.

4/ The problem: Identifying re-aging requires careful analysis of multiple dates. Legal aid attorneys often don't have time for this detective work.

5/ The solution: We built a free tool that automates this analysis. Upload a credit report snippet → get instant analysis → generate dispute letters.

6/ Pilot results: 25% detection rate for high-severity violations. 1.5 hours saved per case. 67% successful dispute rate.

7/ Want to try it? It's free for personal and nonprofit use and 100% private. Commercial use requires a paid license. No client data leaves your computer.
