# About Debt Re-Aging Case Factory

## What is Debt Re-Aging?

**Debt re-aging** is a deceptive practice where the age of a debt is manipulated to make it appear more recent than it actually is. This can illegally extend how long negative information stays on your credit report.

### How It Works

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), most negative items must be removed from your credit report **7 years from the Date of First Delinquency (DOFD)** - the date you first fell behind on payments and never caught up.

When a debt is sold or transferred to a collection agency, some furnishers report a new "date opened" as if the account is new, rather than preserving the original DOFD. This "re-ages" the debt, potentially keeping it on your report longer than legally allowed.

### Legal Framework

The FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681c) establishes the 7-year reporting period for most negative information. The Date of First Delinquency is defined as the date of the delinquency immediately preceding collection activity or charge-off. This date should remain constant regardless of how many times the debt is sold or transferred.

## What This Tool Does

This tool helps identify potential debt re-aging by:

1. **Extracting text** from credit report snippets (PDF or image)
2. **Parsing key dates** and account information
3. **Running automated checks** for timeline inconsistencies
4. **Generating dispute documentation** if issues are found

## About the Developer

This tool was built by **[Mukund Thiru](https://contactmukundthiru-cyber.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/)**, a student researcher passionate about using technology to help people.

### Mission

The goal of this project is simple: make it easier for everyday people to fight back against unfair credit reporting practices. Millions of Americans have errors on their credit reports, but most don't have the time, knowledge, or resources to dispute them effectively.

By automating the detection process and generating proper dispute letters, this tool aims to:

- **Level the playing field** between consumers and large credit bureaus
- **Support legal aid organizations** that help people who can't afford attorneys
- **Expose systematic problems** in how debts are reported and transferred
- **Make the dispute process accessible** to anyone, not just legal professionals

### Why This Matters

Credit report errors can cost people jobs, housing, and loans. Debt re-aging is particularly harmful because it extends the damage for years beyond what the law allows. Yet enforcement is weak, and most violations go unchallenged simply because they're hard to detect.

This tool is one small step toward fixing that.
