# About Debt Re-Aging Case Factory

## What is Debt Re-Aging?

**Debt re-aging** is a deceptive practice where the age of a debt is manipulated to make it appear more recent than it actually is. This can illegally extend how long negative information stays on your credit report.

### How It Works

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), most negative items must be removed from your credit report **7 years from the Date of First Delinquency (DOFD)** - the date you first fell behind on payments and never caught up.

When a debt is sold or transferred to a collection agency, some furnishers report a new "date opened" as if the account is new, rather than preserving the original DOFD. This "re-ages" the debt, potentially keeping it on your report longer than legally allowed.

### Legal Framework

The FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681c) establishes the 7-year reporting period for most negative information. The Date of First Delinquency is defined as the date of the delinquency immediately preceding collection activity or charge-off. This date should remain constant regardless of how many times the debt is sold or transferred.
