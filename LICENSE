## 1) Overview (Community + Commercial)
The Software is offered under two possible license paths:

- **Community License (Non-Commercial)** (default): free to use for personal and
  nonprofit purposes, subject to the restrictions below.
- **Commercial License**: required for any Commercial Use (defined below) and is
  a paid license.

If your use is not permitted under the Community License (Non-Commercial), you must obtain
a Commercial License before using the Software.

## 2) Community License Grant (Personal + Nonprofit Use)
Subject to the terms below, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable license to:

- use the Software for personal use; or for internal nonprofit purposes only;
- copy the Software as reasonably necessary for permitted use; and
- modify the Software for permitted use.

### 2.1) Who Qualifies
**Personal use** means use by an individual for their own personal, non-commercial purposes.

**Nonprofit use** means use by an organization that is organized and operated on a
not-for-profit basis under applicable law and that does not distribute profits to owners
or shareholders, solely for internal nonprofit purposes.

Individuals acting on behalf of a qualifying nonprofit (employees, volunteers,
contractors) may use the Software solely for the benefit of that nonprofit.

### 2.2) Restrictions (Community License)
The following restrictions apply to the Community License (Non-Commercial):

- Redistribution of the Software, in whole or in part, is prohibited.
- No sublicensing.
- Nonprofit use is permitted for internal purposes only.
- No offering as a hosted service to third parties.

For clarity, you may NOT redistribute, publish, sublicense, sell, rent, lease,
lend, or otherwise provide the Software (original or modified) to any third
party, except that you may share copies internally within the same legal
entity for permitted nonprofit use.

For clarity, you may NOT make the Software publicly available (including hosting the
Software, its build artifacts, or a fork in a public repository) under the Community
License.

## 3) Commercial License Required for Commercial Use
Commercial Use is not permitted under the Community License.
Commercial use requires a paid license (a separate written Commercial License from the
copyright holder).

### 3.1) Commercial Use (Definition)
"Commercial Use" includes, without limitation:
- use by a for-profit entity;
- use that is intended to generate revenue or reduce costs for a commercial
  offering;
- offering the Software or its functionality as part of a paid product or
  service (SaaS, hosting, consulting, or otherwise);
- offering the Software as a hosted service to third parties (paid or free);
- charging fees for access to the Software; or
- using the Software to provide services to third parties for a fee.

Nonprofit status alone does not automatically make a use non-commercial if the
Software is used as part of a revenue-generating offering.
