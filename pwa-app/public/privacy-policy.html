  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective-date">Last Updated: January 2025</p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Key Point:</strong> This application processes all data locally on your device.
    No personal information, credit report data, or analysis results are ever transmitted
    to external servers or third parties.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Credit Report Analyzer ("Application", "we", "us") is a Progressive Web Application
    designed to help consumers identify potential Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and
    Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) violations in their credit reports. This
    Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <h3>2.1 What We DO NOT Collect</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Credit Report Data:</strong> Your credit report text, parsed data, and analysis results never leave your device</li>
    <li><strong>No Personal Identifiers:</strong> We do not collect names, addresses, Social Security numbers, or account numbers</li>
    <li><strong>No Analytics Tracking:</strong> We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or similar tracking services</li>
    <li><strong>No Cookies:</strong> We do not set tracking cookies</li>
    <li><strong>No Server Logs:</strong> Static hosting means no server-side logging of your activity</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>
    The Application uses your browser's localStorage to save:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your analysis history (for your convenience in returning to previous analyses)</li>
    <li>Application preferences (dark mode, language settings)</li>
    <li>Discovery checklist answers</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is stored only on your device and can be cleared at any time through your
    browser settings or by using the Application's "Clear All Data" function.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    All data processing occurs entirely within your web browser:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Credit report parsing</li>
    <li>Violation detection and analysis</li>
    <li>Letter and document generation</li>
    <li>PDF creation and export</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Zero-Network Architecture:</strong> The Application is designed to function
    completely offline after initial download. No API calls are made during analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The Application includes the following third-party libraries, all of which operate
    locally without external network calls:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tesseract.js:</strong> For OCR (Optical Character Recognition) of credit report images - processes entirely in-browser</li>
    <li><strong>PDF.js:</strong> For extracting text from PDF files - processes entirely in-browser</li>
    <li><strong>jsPDF:</strong> For generating PDF documents - processes entirely in-browser</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is protected by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Client-side only processing (data never transmitted)</li>
    <li>HTTPS encryption for Application delivery</li>
    <li>Optional encryption for localStorage data</li>
    <li>No external database or cloud storage</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because your data never leaves your device, you have complete control:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> View your stored data anytime through the Application</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Clear all data using browser settings or the Application's clear function</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Export your analyses as PDF or text files</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This Application is not intended for use by individuals under 18 years of age.
    Credit reports are typically only available to adults.
  </p>

  <h2>8. GDPR Compliance (EU Users)</h2>
  <p>
    For users in the European Union:

    <li>No personal data is processed on our servers (no data controller obligations apply)</li>
    <li>Local storage usage is for essential Application functionality only</li>
    <li>You may request confirmation of our zero-collection policy at any time</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. CCPA Compliance (California Users)</h2>

    <li>We do not sell personal information</li>
    <li>We do not collect personal information for commercial purposes</li>
    <li>No opt-out is required because no data collection occurs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>

    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be indicated by
    updating the "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Application after changes
    constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
