  "notes": "This private student loan collection shows issues: (1) Date opened (2021) is nearly 4 years after DOFD (2017), (2) Removal date (2028) appears calculated from the collector's open date rather than DOFD. Based on DOFD of 03/2017, removal should have been around 2024. Note: Federal student loans have different rules and may not follow the 7-year FCRA timeline."
