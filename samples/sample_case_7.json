  "notes": "This utility collection is properly dated. While the date opened (09/2021) is 17 months after DOFD (04/2020), this is within the 24-month threshold and represents a reasonable time for debt to be placed in collections. The removal date of 04/2027 correctly aligns with 7 years from the DOFD."
