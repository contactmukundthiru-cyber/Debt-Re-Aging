**Re: Formal Request for Debt Validation - 15 U.S.C. § 1692g**

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter in response to your recent communication regarding the account referenced above. This is not a refusal to pay, but a formal request for validation of the debt pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1692g.

I request that you provide the following information and documentation:

1. **Proof of Authority:** Documentation showing your legal authority to collect this debt, including any assignment or purchase agreement between you and the original creditor.
2. **Original Account Records:** A copy of the original signed contract or agreement that created this debt.
3. **Calculation of Debt:** A complete itemization of the alleged debt, including the original principal amount, and any interest or fees added since the account was charged off.
4. **Delinquency Information:** The specific date of first delinquency with the original creditor.
5. **Licensing:** Verification that you are licensed to collect debts in my state of residence.

Please be advised that if you fail to provide this validation within 30 days, you must cease all collection activities, including reporting this information to credit bureaus.

If you have already reported this debt to any credit reporting agency, you must now mark the account as "disputed" as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1692e(8).

I look forward to receiving your prompt response with the requested documentation.

Sincerely,
