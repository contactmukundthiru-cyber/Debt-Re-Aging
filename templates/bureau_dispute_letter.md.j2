**Re: Dispute of Inaccurate Information - Request for Investigation and Correction**

To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing pursuant to my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq., to dispute information appearing on my credit report that I believe to be inaccurate.

## Account Information Being Disputed

| Field | Reported Value |
|-------|----------------|
| Furnisher/Creditor | {{ fields.furnisher_or_collector or fields.original_creditor or '[CREDITOR NAME]' }} |
{% if fields.original_creditor and fields.furnisher_or_collector %}
| Original Creditor | {{ fields.original_creditor }} |
{% endif %}
| Account Type | {{ fields.account_type or '[ACCOUNT TYPE]' }} |
| Date Opened as Reported | {{ fields.date_opened | format_date if fields.date_opened else '[DATE OPENED]' }} |
{% if fields.dofd %}
| Date of First Delinquency | {{ fields.dofd | format_date }} |
{% endif %}
| Estimated Removal Date | {{ fields.estimated_removal_date | format_date if fields.estimated_removal_date else '[REMOVAL DATE]' }} |

## Basis for Dispute

I am disputing this account because the reported information appears to contain timeline inaccuracies that may constitute improper debt re-aging or misreporting of the account's history.

{% if has_flags %}
Specifically, I have identified the following concerns:

{% for flag in flags %}
**{{ loop.index }}. {{ flag.rule_name }}**

{{ flag.explanation }}

{% endfor %}
{% else %}
I request verification of the accuracy of all dates and information associated with this account.
{% endif %}

## Request for Action

Pursuant to the FCRA, I request that you:

1. **Conduct a reasonable investigation** into the accuracy of the disputed information within 30 days of receiving this dispute.

2. **Contact the furnisher** of this information to verify its accuracy, including all reported dates.

3. **Provide me with the results** of your investigation in writing, including:
   - A description of the procedure used to determine accuracy
   - The business name and address of any furnisher contacted
   - A notice that I may request a description of the method used to verify

4. **Delete or correct** any information that cannot be verified as accurate.

5. **Provide a free copy** of my credit report if any changes are made.

## Documentation

I am enclosing copies of relevant documentation to support this dispute. Please see the attached checklist for a list of enclosed materials.

## Legal Notice

Please be advised that under the FCRA:

- You must conduct a reasonable investigation within 30 days (15 U.S.C. § 1681i(a)(1))
- Failure to investigate or correct inaccurate information may constitute a willful violation
- I reserve all rights to pursue statutory and actual damages for any violations
