## 2. Reasonable Investigation Findings

Based on a forensic comparison between the servicing system (Core Ledger) and the credit bureau reporting file:

{% if results.inconsistencies %}
### ⚠️ INCONSISTENCIES DETECTED
The following fields do not align with the internal record of delinquency:
{% for error in results.inconsistencies %}
- **{{ error.field }}**: {{ error.message }}
{% endfor %}

**Remediation Action Required:**
- Use **Segment J2 Update** to correct DOFD in next reporting batch.
- Update Status Code to match servicing system.
{% else %}
### ✅ DATA INTEGRITY VERIFIED
The Metro2 reporting segment for this account is logically consistent with the internal servicing ledger. No re-aging risks were detected during this audit.
{% endif %}
