## Request for Action

As a furnisher of information to consumer reporting agencies, you have obligations under the FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2) to:

1. **Report only accurate information** to consumer reporting agencies

2. **Investigate disputes** forwarded by consumer reporting agencies and correct any inaccuracies

3. **Not report information** you know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate

I am requesting that you:

1. **Conduct a thorough investigation** of the accuracy of all dates associated with this account, particularly:
   - The Date of First Delinquency (DOFD)
   - The account opening date
   - The estimated removal date

2. **Correct any inaccurate information** with all consumer reporting agencies to which you have furnished data

3. **Provide me with documentation** verifying the accuracy of the reported dates, including:
   - Records establishing the Date of First Delinquency
   - Documentation of the account history
   - Basis for the reported removal date

4. **Confirm in writing** what actions you have taken in response to this dispute

## Legal Framework

Please note that under the FCRA:

- Furnishers must report accurate information (15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(a))
- Furnishers must investigate consumer disputes (15 U.S.C. § 1681s-2(b))
- Reporting debt with a reset or inaccurate date of first delinquency may constitute illegal debt re-aging
- Willful or negligent violations may result in statutory damages, actual damages, punitive damages, and attorney's fees

I am also sending a copy of this dispute to the credit bureau(s) reporting this information.

## Response Requested

Please respond to this dispute within 30 days with:

1. Confirmation of the investigation conducted
2. Documentation supporting the reported dates
3. Notice of any corrections made to the consumer reporting agencies
